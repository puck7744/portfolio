# The Den of Marbletown
http://www.denofmarbletown.com

For this project I provided affordable translation of existing design sensibilities into a functional custom theme for Wordpress 4.1 that maintained the classical aesthetic.

The client also desired an online presence for their traditional shop which was accomplished using the well known WooCommerce extension.

Additional accomplishments of this project included:

* Edit the original background image to tile seamlessly
* Create functional and customizable menus for the top and main navigation bars
* Implement a custom lightbox/gallery solution with a simple management interface
* Translate existing design features like triple borders into pure CSS solutions
