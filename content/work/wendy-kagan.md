# Wendy Kagan

In the case of Wendy Kagan I was contracted to revive a site that had been completely disabled by malicious intruders. As part of the recovery process I compared active records to existing backups, migrated and updated content, swept existing files for malicious code and closed the gaps that had allowed access in the first place.

With recovery complete I proceeded to update existing software and perform a full security evaluation to guard against any future attacks.
