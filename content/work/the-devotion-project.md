# The Devotion Project
http://www.thedevotionproject.org/

A series of award winning web documentaries, The Devotion Project provided a unique opportunity and challenge. Leveraging extensive knowledge of disparate platforms, I was able to provide a low-cost solution based on the Silex web framework.

By minimizing server-side code I was able to help keep server overhead low while maintaining the essential functions required by a client with specific needs.

Hand coded functionality in the final build included:

* User authentication
* Minimal WYSIWYG content management
* Easy to use embedded video functionality
* Custom contact form with XSS and anti-spam protection
* Verified mobile friendliness using the Google test
