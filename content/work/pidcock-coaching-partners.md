# Pidcock Coaching Partners
http://www.pcpidcock.com/

In the case of Pidcock Coaching Partners I converted a traditional design into a dynamic website easily updatable by the client. PHP, CSS and Javascript were used to provide eye catching dynamic elements such as slide shows and randomized quotes based on original design.

Image based text was converted into search enabled web font text and certain design elements were updated to maximize user friendliness on the new platform.

Additional services:

* Mass conversion of existing content
* Special styling for specific pages
* Enabling simple blogging
* Search engine optimization
