# Stylo Furniture & Design
http://www.stylo-fd.com/

In the case of Stylo Furniture & Design I provided triage services for an existing Wordpress 4.0 site that was malfunctioning.

By drawing on experience with a variety of issues I was able to...

* ...restore functionality of the ecommerce shop
* ...implement new contact form funcitonality
* ...allow the client to cleanly and simply open and close portions of the site that were not ready for prime time
* ...provide search engine optimization and counseling
* ...bring all existing software and plugins up to date with current releases
