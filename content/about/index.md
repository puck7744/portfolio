# Hi,

![](/img/tristan-shelton.jpg)
my name is Tristan and I'm a freelance full stack web developer, UI designer and technical consultant. I specialize in concept implementation and CMS systems, but with over a decade of professional experience and a thirst for knowledge I can handle pretty much any project.

Some of my past experience includes:

* Developing custom themes, plugins and modifiers for existing CMS systems (Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, ....)
* Mobile and desktop UI/UX design and implementation
* AJAX-based single page UI development
* Socket-level communications for web applications
* Back end development using existing and custom frameworks
* Design and implementation of RESTful APIs
* Triage of server security breaches
* Custom database design and large volume data handling
* Technical consultation on framework and software solutions

If you're looking for a developer that can transform your project parameters into [clean code](https://github.com/puck7744/portfolio) with a low turn around time, [look no further](/contact).
